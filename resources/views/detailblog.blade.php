                  <p>At checkout you'll find it a breeze to complete your order and finalise your online shopping visit. If you have already registered your e-mail address with adidas, or created an account at our store before, you can use your e-mail address to login. Otherwise, you can checkout as guest or create an account. Having an account will give you access to handy features such as the address book and your personal order history.

                  The first two steps of the checkout ask for your delivery and billing address. If your billing address is the same as your delivery address, simply check the checkbox and the billing address will be filled out automatically. If you have stored an address during previous checkouts, you can also use the address book to select it.

                  Next up is the payment information. After entering all your data on this page and clicking continue, no money will be transferred from your card unless you confirm your order on the next page. Please note that to ensure the safety of your data, your credit card data will not be stored on our systems.

                  When your payment information is completed you will enter a screen with your adidas order overview. Please check all the information on this page, since this is your last chance to correct it. After hitting "Confirm Order", your order will be processed and sent to the warehouse. From this point on, you can track your order in your account.

                  <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
